## Purpose

* To Develop Applications of Raspberry Pi Pico Using C Language and Assembler Language

**About Raspberry Pi Pico**

* Raspberry Pi Pico is a single-board microcontroller.

* The chip on Raspberry Pi Pico is RP2040, an original microcontroller By Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd.

* On the forum releasing Raspberry Pi 4, a piece of the RP 2040 data sheet is mixed as the Raspberry Pi 4. This chip is long-awaited one for learners and hobbyists.

## Notes on Projects

* Projects may output and input strings through USB. To monitor these, use minicom.

**Blinkers**

* Outputs: GPIO14 (PMW7 A), GPIO15, GPIO16, and GPIO25 (Embedded LED)

* I tested an output with a 3.0mm red LED and a 1K ohms resistor in series.

**Twin Dimmers**

* This project is using ADC. I connected ADC_VREF to 3V3, and AGND to GND. GPIO26 (ADC0) and GPIO27 (ADC1) are used as ADC inputs. Two ADC inputs are converted to digital values with the round robin mode, and these values are used for controlling brightness of two LED outputs from GPIO14 and GPIO15 using PWM.

* I tested this with two B10K ohms potentiometers for ADC inputs.

* PWM emits 1000Hz noise. On the minimum value, PWM doesn't emit 1000Hz because of all ranged low state. On the maximum value, PWM doesn't emit 1000Hz because of all ranged high state.

* On the open state of ADC input, the PWM output shakes. I connected a PWM output to a piezoelectric speaker and a 10K ohms resistor in series. Although we should consider the electric stability on the open state, the shaking of the sound would fit with human factors in view of our awareness because of resembling the sound of a bell.

**Servo**

* I applied FEETECH FS90 Servo Motor. I connected its brown wire to GND, its red wire to VBUS, and its orange wire to GPIO2 (PWM0 A). Double-check the actual wiring layout of your servo motor by an official document. I measured approx. 105-110 degrees rotation with 900-2100us pulses which is assumed 120 degrees rotation, and it seems to be just 10% difference. Note that Pico outputs 3.3V signal, even though I connected this signal to FS90 which is driven by 5V from VBUS. 3.3V (OUT) didn't work for FS90.

* In the setting with the 20ms pulse interval, the inner motor of FS90 didn't stop in the 900us pulse that makes the angle of 0 degrees in 120 degrees. By changing the setting to the 12.5ms pulse interval, the inner motor stopped in the 900us pulse.

* "servo_adc" uses ADC0 as an input. I tested this with a B10K ohms potentiometer for the ADC input.

* "servo_console" accepts an input from a console. I only tested this with minicom in Ubuntu via the USB connection.

**Func**

* This project outputs a sine wave from GPIO15 (PWM7 B).

* According to the page 147-148 of RP2040 Datasheet, ROM (0x0000_0000) of RP2040 includes utilities for fast floating point as firmware. The actual code is in [mufplib.S written by Mark Owen](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-bootrom/blob/master/bootrom/mufplib.S). Note that the binaries seems to be loaded to SRAM, and I can't check these in the disassembling file (func.dis in this case).

**Pedal**

* This project is making several types of guitar pedals.

* Caution that this project needs an analogue circuit to receive and output the audio signal, i.e., a DC bias on receiving, low-pass filters on outputting (in case of stereo outputting, this project outputs audio signals from two PWM channels).

* Pedals decides the middle point of the wave by the moving average. The number of moving average is fixed. The more number is slow to move the middle point. Whereas, the less number is fast, but is effected by the large peak of the wave.

* ADC0 inputs an audio signal. Whereas ADC1 and ADC2 input values of potentiometers to control effects.

* "pedal_buffer" is a just buffer with -18.06dB (Loss 8) to 18.06dB (Gain 8). This also implements a noise gate with -60.2dB (Loss 1024) to -36.7dB (Loss 68) in ADC_VREF. ADC_VREF is typically 3.3V, and in this case the gate cuts 3.2mVp-p to 48mVp-p. The noise gate has the combination of the hysteresis and the time counting after triggering. I set the hysteresis is the half of the threshold, and the time counting is fixed. Note that the time counting effects the sustain. ADC0 is for the audio input, ADC1 is for the loss or the gain, and ADC2 is for the noise gate. One of two outputs is inverted for balanced monaural.

* "pedal_sideband". This pedal is hinted by a rotating fan which changes your voice. This effect by a rotating fan can be described by a Fourier transform, i.e., you add a pulsating wave to produce a sideband like a radio wave. In my testing, sine waves have harmonics by this pedal. Note that I renamed this pedal from "pedal_chorus" to "pedal_sideband", and I think this pedal is identified as an octave pedal. It's made from the mouse-on-a-wall approach for the chorus effect. I recommend this pedal not just for guitars, but also for basses. Fundamentally, this effect is like the system of synthesizers. To make this function on an analogue circuit, this would be a ring modulator. One of two outputs is added the pulsating wave, and another is added the inverted pulsating wave. ADC0 is for the audio input, ADC1 is for the loss or the gain, and ADC2 is for the noise gate. Frequencies of main pulsating wave and sub pulsating wave are fixed so far.

## Technical Notes

**I/O**

```C
uint32 from_time = time_us_32();
printf("@main 1 - Let's Start!\n");
pedal_buffer_debug_time = time_us_32() - from_time;
printf("@main 2 - pedal_buffer_debug_time %d\n", pedal_buffer_debug_time);
```

* In this coding as above, the time showed approx. 350 micro seconds with the embedded USB 2.0. However, USB 2.0 becomes a popular middle range communicator. The recommended length of a USB 2.0 cable is up to 5 meters (16 feet), but you can purchase a USB 2.0 cable which has a signal booster, and the length is 10 meters (32 feet).

* The PWM interrupt seems to overlap after clearing its interrupt flag ("pwm_clear_irq"). More experiments are needed to probe this phenomenon.

* When you output the audio signal with PWM on approx. 30518Hz (12-bit resolution per cycle with the 125Mhz clock speed), you are allowed to spend approx. 30 micro seconds for a cycle. The 125Mhz clock speed spends 0.008 micro seconds per clock, and 30 micro seconds includes 3750 clocks. These clocks may be enough on processing with integer, but may not be enough on processing with floating point decimal. To utilize decimal, you can use fixed point decimal, and a number table with expected values that is already calculated by functions such as sine. For example:

```C
uint32 from_time = time_us_32();
pwm_set_chan_level(func_pwm_slice_num, func_pwm_channel, function_generator_pico_sine(function_generator) + FUNC_PWM_OFFSET);
if(function_generator->is_end) {
    function_generator->factor = func_next_factor;
    function_generator->is_end = false;
}
func_debug_time = time_us_32() - from_time;
```

* In this coding as above the time showed 9-10 micro seconds. 2-3 times are allowed to use the sine function in the 30 seconds.

* On outputting PWM with quantized audio signal by ADC, the noise is not only from 30518Hz at PWM cycle, but also from the misalignment of ADC sampling. The noise from the misalignment of the sampling is under 30518Hz, and it could pass your low-pass filter. In PWM IRQ, the timing to start ADC sampling should be stable. Conditional branches before starting ADC sampling cause the misalignment.

* RP2040 has 5 ADC inputs (ADC0-4), and ADC4 is dedicated for a implemented temperature sensor. Pico can be freely used 3 ADC inputs, and ADC3 is connected to the VSYS/3 measurement (see page 7 and page 24 of Raspberry Pi Pico Datasheet). Third-party RP2040 hardware may be able to use 4 ADC inputs. You also see page 579 of RP2040 Datasheet to check the note which describes existence of diodes on ADC inputs. However, for safety, you need each zener diode to IOVDD and GND on the audio input. The input impedance is 100K ohms at minimum (see page 634 of RP2040 Datasheet). This impedance is small as an input from a coil pick up of an electric guitar, and the direct connection apparently reduces the harmonics in my experience.
