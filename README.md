# Kenta Ishii's Projects on Raspberry Pi Pico

### Information of this README and comments in this project may be incorrect. This project is not an official document of Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd., and other holders of any Intellectual Property (IP).

## Purpose

* To Develop Applications of Raspberry Pi Pico Using C Language and Assembler Language

**About Raspberry Pi Pico**

* Raspberry Pi Pico is a single-board microcontroller.

* The chip on Raspberry Pi Pico is RP2040, an original microcontroller By Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd.

* On the forum releasing Raspberry Pi 4, a piece of the RP 2040 data sheet is mixed as the Raspberry Pi 4. This chip is long-awaited one for learners and hobbyists.

## Installation

* I'm using Linux-based Ubuntu 20.04 LTS in an AMD64 machine. Also Refer [Raspberry Pi Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk).

```bash
# Install Packages to Be Needed
sudo apt install cmake gcc-arm-none-eabi libnewlib-arm-none-eabi build-essential
sudo apt install libstdc++-arm-none-eabi-newlib
sudo apt install minicom
# Make Directory
mkdir ~/pico_projects
cd ~/pico_projects
# Install Projects
git clone -b master https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk.git
git clone -b main https://github.com/JimmyKenMerchant/raspi_pico.git
# Install TinyUSB as A Submodule of pico-sdk
cd pico-sdk
git submodule update --init
cd ../
# Import CMAKE File in PICO-SDK to My Projects
cp pico-sdk/external/pico_sdk_import.cmake raspi_pico/
# Build
cd raspi_pico
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make -j4
# Connect Pico and Your PC through USB2.0
# Push and Hold "BOOTSEL" Button on Connecting to Your PC
# Copy, Paste, and Run!
cp blinkers/blinkers.uf2 /media/$USER/RPI-RP2/
# Monitor "printf" Messages from Console
sudo minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyACM0
```

## Notes on Projects

**Twin Dimmers**

* This project is using ADC. I connected ADC_VREF to 3V3, and AGND to GND. GPIO26 (ADC0) and GPIO27 (ADC1) are used as ADC inputs. Two ADC inputs are converted to digital values with the round robin mode, and these values are used for controlling brightness of two LED outputs from GPIO14 and GPIO15 using PWM.

* I tested this with two B10K ohms potentiometers for ADC inputs.

**Servo**

* I applied FEETECH FS90 Servo Motor. I connected its brown wire to GND, its red wire to VBUS, and its orange wire to GPIO2 (PWM0 A). Double-check the actual wiring layout of your servo motor by an official document. I measured approx. 105-110 degrees rotation with 900-2100us pulses which is assumed 120 degrees rotation. Note that Pico outputs 3.3V signal, even though I connected this signal to FS90 which is driven by 5V from VBUS. 3.3V (OUT) didn't work for FS90.

* "servo_adc" uses ADC0 as an input. I tested this with a B10K ohms potentiometer for the ADC input.

* "servo_console" accepts an input from a console. I only tested this with minicom in Ubuntu via the USB connection.
